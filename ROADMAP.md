# Roadmap

Where u-and-i is and what's next. Update this as priorities shift — it's the
first thing a new session should read after CLAUDE.md.

## Where we are (2026-08-15)

Code-is-truth editor serving one real Next.js app (adventure-alerts).
Working today: route interpretation + follow-the-shell, live rendering of
client components with sample props, full structural AST editing (insert/
delete/move/duplicate/drag-drop with import management + fidelity guard),
in-place text editing on the canvas, byte-perfect undo, per-project session
+ preferences, Style/Workshop writing to the app's real globals.css.

## Next (near-term, high value)

- **Render the real app** — the headline gap. Pages that load data (e.g.
  `/account`) show nothing today. Target: the canvas shows the target's
  own running `next dev`, with real data and the real layout chrome, and
  every element still maps back to source. Supersedes both "compose views
  in their shells" and the assisted-mode compromise.
- **Editing dynamic regions** — the biggest editability gap. Map callbacks,
  ternary branches, expression props, dynamic `style`/`className` are
  read-only pseudo-content today. Start with the safest slices: editing
  string literals inside expressions, then the JSX inside map callbacks
  (already real indexed nodes — mostly a UI trust problem, edits apply to
  the template).
- **Compose views in their shells** — render a page's view inside the real
  layout chrome (Header/Sidebar/ContentArea around HomeView) so editing
  happens in context. The shell components already render; this is a
  wrapper-composition feature in the harness.
- **wrap-element** AST op (wrap selection in a flex container) — deferred
  from the edit-engine milestone for reprint risk; the fidelity guard makes
  it safe to attempt now.

## Later

- **Route scaffolding** — "new page" returns: create `src/app/<route>/page.tsx`
  as plain hand-editable code from the Routes tree.
- **Sample-prop capture depth** — richer payloads for big view-model props
  (home-view's 14 props); possibly record real props from a running
  `next dev` session.
- **Generic targets** — the canvas chrome (fonts, session shape, provider
  stack, icon SVG defs) has adventure-alerts-specific pieces; make them a
  per-target config so any Next app renders faithfully. Add target
  switching to Preferences / an Electron folder picker.
- **Style workspace depth** — the token category map was tuned against the
  old fixture copy of globals.css; re-verify occurrence mapping against the
  real file, and grow token coverage.
- **Cross-file cut/paste** of elements.

## Someday

- Electron packaging (electron-builder), app icon, auto-update.
- Multi-select, marquee selection, alignment guides.
- Keyboard remapping, default-device preference (placeholders already in
  the Preferences window).
- Visual diff/review panel (show the session's git diff inside the editor).

## Standing constraints

No save format ever; no git operations in the target; fidelity guard stays
mandatory for every new edit op.

Not a constraint — a gap: today's canvas can't show pages that load real
data, because the harness aliases `@/db`, `@/auth` and `next/headers` to
stubs that raise an error on any access. `npm run dev` eats real data, so
this should too. See "Render the real app" above; the old "assisted mode"
wording made a workaround sound permanent.
